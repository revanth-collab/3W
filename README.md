I was not able to deploy the Backend Code so please do some little work to run the node.js code also. Thank You

1. First the git clone my code into your Local System.
2. using "git clone https://github.com/revanth-collab/3W.git"

**Backend Node.js code:**
  1. navigate to the server directory
  2. using "cd server"
  3. run the Node.js code by command "node server.js"

**Frontend React.js Code:**
  1. open the other terminal
  2. navigate to the client directory
  3. using the "cd client"
  4. run the React.js code by command  "npm start"

Thank you.
